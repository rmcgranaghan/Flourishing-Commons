## Research Center: The Flourishing Commons
The Flourishing Commons is a new 'research center without a center' that aims to pioneer 'Flourishing Studies' by:
- Undertaking scientific research into 'Wicked Problems'
- Fostering transdisciplinary collaboration and inherently distributed (geographically and conceptually) networks of institutions and researchers
- Investigating literacies and metrics of flourishing
- Studying interaction across different media
- Cultivating deliberate friendships
- Promoting prosociality and civic engagement
- Enacting the civics of science
- Nurturing creativity and curiosity
- Studying our own research and research processes to understand flourishing
- Creating artifacts that enable others to follow this model. 

Join us in exploring the depth and breadth of human flourishing!
