# A Library of Flourishing
A curated list of writings, studies, works of art, people, and places that bear on a new conception of flourishing for the world we are walking into. Flourishing as the response to the question, 'How do we live well with and for each other.' Always unfinished. Contributions encouraged. 

>''Each is an intention to connect to the past and to reach into the future, each a memory of the people who wrote it, multiplied by the memories of the travelers who brought it here, the people who have read it, the people who never will'' -Anna Badkhen

- [Rap on Race](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484137.A_Rap_on_Race) by Margaret Mead and James Baldwin. A series of conversations from two of the true luminaries of the 20th century. At times flooring in how prescient it is to our modern world (also a reminder of the terrible timelessness of some of these ideas). A rap on race, indeed, but also on disparity, power asymmetry, oppression, poetry, the way cultures develop, social construction of much of our modern world, responsibility, morality and ethics, and ways of thinking about the past, present, and future.

A treatise on social Justice whose position begins from the question: What are people really able to do and to be? It lays out the philosophical framework and then proceeds to place it in context historically and in the modern world. Strong connections to Amartya Sen and Thomas Rawls before it and into individuals like Danielle Allen and Ai-Jen Poo after. 
An essential read for anyone concerned with human (our and living being) suffering
- [Justice by Means of Democracy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62707936-justice-by-means-of-democracy) by Danielle Allen


## Communities and Organizations
- [Flourishing Salons](https://ryanmcgranaghan.substack.com/p/an-evening-of-encountering-flourishing). Pluralistic conversations and a modern reimagining of the salons of the 17th and 18th centuries. Founded and run by Ryan McGranaghan, these are held in cooperation with organizations like the Cultural Programs of the National Academy of Science and are a way to grow a new Community of Practice that operates in the spaces between fields of science, art, engineering, design, culture, public and private life. They are the live counerpart to the living, cross-medium, active and asynchronous conversations that characterize a commons.

## Frameworks

## Libraries or Compilations of Resources
- [Flourishing Commons](https://ryanmcgranaghan.substack.com/about). A newsletter attempting to give language to and be a space for knowledge and cultural commons. Posts are musings about the flourishing of these commons across science, community, writing, design, complexity, engineering, music and the intriguing echoes between them

## Reports


## Flourishing Studies
_This is a heading that holds resources that are part of building a field of flourishing studies. We need a more robust conception of flourishing for the world we are walking into, a conception furnishing of new multiscale and multi-medium interactions, the ways of making legible when a system is flourishing, and new groups and institutions capable of responding to the call to flourishing. As flourishing is something we must practice and, in that experience, understand, the belief was that the exploration must be situated within the research domain now. We must have it as the philosophy undergirding how we do research and as the focus of research._
- _[Towards Flourishing Studies: A network lens on flourishing](https://zenodo.org/records/10463898)_ McGranaghan et al. Our grand challenges in science are those for which we cannot ignore the complexity of the world--the interconnectedness of our disciplines, systems, and groups. How do we embrace complexity in the project of scientific discovery? This is perhaps the threshold question for our moment in the Earth and Space Sciences. These authors use the lens of network science in outlining the tools, technologies, processes, and literacies required to embrace complexity and make frontier scientific discovery. They present studies from across contexts that use network science to respond to 'wicked problems' as well as to study social interactions and communities. They explore how networks might provide insight into the flourishing of science and scientific communities, ultimately sharing new network science research into scientific progress and community that suggest principles of flourishing. A conversation is ignited around a new kind of science of 'flourishing studies.
- [What science can do for democracy: a complexity science approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0518-0). An exploration of how to understand democracy (a process integrally related to flourishing) from the perspective of complexity science.

## Essays and perspectives

## Events and Conferences

## Media
- [Origins Podcast](https://www.originspodcast.show/). Conversations with thought-leaders across an eclectic mix of disciplines (science, engineering, art, and design), crafted specifically for the category-defying society that we live in. The discourse is always driven toward the questions of what does it mean to flourishing and how do we live well with and for each other.
