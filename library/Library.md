# A Library of Flourishing
A curated list of writings, studies, works of art, people, and places that bear on a new conception of flourishing for the world we are walking into. Flourishing as the response to the question, 'How do we live well with and for each other.' Always unfinished. Contributions encouraged. 

>''Each is an intention to connect to the past and to reach into the future, each a memory of the people who wrote it, multiplied by the memories of the travelers who brought it here, the people who have read it, the people who never will'' -Anna Badkhen

- [Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons (SEEKCommons)](https://seekcommons.org/). How can Open Science (OS) contribute to the present and future of socio-environmental research? Why is this question worth pursuing through a distributed network of STS researchers, OS practitioners, and socio-environmental researchers working with climate-impacted communities? The U.S. National Science Foundation “Socio-Environmental Knowledge Commons” (SEEKCommons) project seeks to respond to these questions by promoting the “commons” in science and technology with an emphasis on collaborative socio-environmental research.

- _[The Global Flourishing Study: Study Profile and Initial Results on Flourishing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00423-5)_ by VanderWeele et al. The Global Flourishing Study is a longitudinal panel study of over 200,000 participants in 22 geographically and culturally diverse countries, spanning all six populated continents, with nationally representative sampling and intended annual survey data collection for 5 years to assess numerous aspects of flourishing and its possible determinants. The study is intended to expand our knowledge of the distribution and determinants of flourishing around the world.

## Flourishing Studies
_This is a heading that holds resources that are part of building a field of flourishing studies. We need a more robust conception of flourishing for the world we are walking into, a conception furnishing of new multiscale and multi-medium interactions, the ways of making legible when a system is flourishing, and new groups and institutions capable of responding to the call to flourishing. As flourishing is something we must practice and, in that experience, understand, the belief was that the exploration must be situated within the research domain now. We must have it as the philosophy undergirding how we do research and as the focus of research._
- _[Towards Flourishing Studies: A network lens on flourishing](https://zenodo.org/records/10463898)_ McGranaghan et al. Our grand challenges in science are those for which we cannot ignore the complexity of the world--the interconnectedness of our disciplines, systems, and groups. How do we embrace complexity in the project of scientific discovery? This is perhaps the threshold question for our moment in the Earth and Space Sciences. These authors use the lens of network science in outlining the tools, technologies, processes, and literacies required to embrace complexity and make frontier scientific discovery. They present studies from across contexts that use network science to respond to 'wicked problems' as well as to study social interactions and communities. They explore how networks might provide insight into the flourishing of science and scientific communities, ultimately sharing new network science research into scientific progress and community that suggest principles of flourishing. A conversation is ignited around a new kind of science of 'flourishing studies.
- [What science can do for democracy: a complexity science approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0518-0). An exploration of how to understand democracy (a process integrally related to flourishing) from the perspective of complexity science.
